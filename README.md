# customer-segmentation-and-analytics


## Description
This project performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
plotly
warnings
silhouette_samples
silhouette_score

##usage
Open `customer_segmentation.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
Run the cells in the notebook to perform the customer segmentation analysis.

## Output
The notebook performs the following tasks:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- using ELBOW method to find number of clusters
- K-Means clustering 
- Visualization of the clusters
- 4D visualization

## Visualizations
The notebook includes visualizations such as scatter plots and 3D scatter plots to illustrate the clusters.
